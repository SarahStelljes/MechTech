# MechTech

## Description
The motivation for making MechTech was simple: to have fun. Of course, this isn't the only reason why I made it. I also wanted to test what I had learned so far. It helped me realize how to build a complete website and how long that can take if you're one person. It took me around 2 1/2 days to complete the functionality of this project, and it can still be improved! While making this, I learned how to use cookies for session time-outs depeding on if the user is innactive or not.
